# FaceitDemoLauncher
Simple tool to quickly open Faceit demos
## Prerequisites
.NET Framework 4.6.1 installed. Not an issue because it's been pre-installed since Windows 10 version 1511 (November 2015).
## Installation
1. Download the latest Setup.msi from the 'Releases'-section on this page
2. Run Setup.msi
## Usage
Drag and drop compressed Faceit demo files either onto the program directly or onto the GUI to set up the extracting process. Files can also be chosen with a file picker. Optionally enter a friendly name for the demo file being extracted. Provided that the game isn't already running, it can now be launched and the file played directly. In addition, the console command for playing your newly extracted file can be copied to clipboard from the UI.
