# FaceitDemoLauncher
Simple tool to quickly open Faceit demos
## Prerequisites
.NET Framework 4.6.1 installed. It's been pre-installed since Windows 10 version 1511 (November 2015) and is bundled in the installer.
## Installation
1. Download the latest setup.zip from the 'Releases'-section on this page
2. Extract anywhere on disk.
3. Run setup.exe.
## Usage
Drag and drop compressed Faceit demo files either onto the program directly or onto the GUI to set up the extracting process. You can also browse for a file normally using the designated button. Optionally enter a friendly name for the demo file being extracted. The game can now be launched and the file played directly, provided that it isn't already running. For this reason, the console command for playing your newly extracted file can be copied to clipboard from the UI.
